		Characteristic Modifiers: +3 Willpower

		Vendetta: Every noble house has its sworn enemies and
		rivals who would do it and its members harm. Even the
		protection of a Rogue Trader’s mission merely forces those who
		wish you harm to be a bit more cautious and subtle in exacting
		their vengeance. As a result, starting noble born characters have
		powerful enemies, perhaps in the shape of a rival noble house
		or some other powerful group. The details of these enemies
		are left to the player and the Game Master to define, working
		together to create a formidable threat. Whilst they do not
		dog the character’s steps at every turn, these enemies aim to
		inconvenience, harm, or kill him whenever he crosses their
		path. The noble character, of course, is free to return the favour
		when it’s expedient to do so.
		Starting Wounds: Noble born characters double their
		starting Toughness Bonus and add 1d5 to the result to

  "Astropath Trancendent": {
    description: `The Astropath Transcendent is a rare individual, indeed. He is a psyker whose powers and very essence has been touched
	  by the light of the God-Emperor himself and who is able to form a lifeline of communication across the limitless gulfs of
	  space, his soul armoured against the gnawing taint of the warp beyond. Each year, uncounted millions of psykers are born
	  across the vast breadth of the Imperium. Most are detected and interred until collected by one of the fearsome Black Ships of
	  the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. These vessels travel the galaxy in great circuits, their stygian holds inexorably filling with nascent
	  psykers with each stop they make. The fate of the vast majority of the psykers is to fuel the insatiable fires of the Astronomican
	  so that the Imperium might be held together for another day. Of those allowed to live, a tiny fraction are judged strong enough
	  to undergo tutorage and go on to serve the Imperium in a staggering array of capacities, from Inquisitor to Battle Psyker.
	  Those chosen to become Astropaths undergo the ritual of Soul Binding, in which the body and soul are scoured clean of the
	  taint of the warp by the searing purity of the Emperor’s beneficence. After months of fasting, prayer, and ritual preparation, the
	  psykers are brought into the very depths of the Emperor’s Palace in processions of a hundred at a time, there to undergo a ritual
	  that will kill them, drive them insane, or bind them for all eternity to the Emperor. So intense is the ritual that the supplicants’
	  sensory organs are almost totally overloaded—leaving them blinded by the experience—with many suffering further nerve
	  damage, incurring loss of smell, touch, or hearing.
	  Relying as heavily as the Imperium does on the warp for galactic communication, it has a great demand for Astropaths, and
	  each newly created Astropath who survives the Soul Binding is inducted into the ranks of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica. There
	  he learns to send his thoughts singing across the galaxy via the medium of the warp, adding his psychic voice to entire choirs
	  of his fellows, and communicating with others of his kind on planets light years distant.
	  It is a rare Astropath indeed who rises beyond his given duties and responsibilities in the ranks of the psychic choirs. Of those
	  few who do so, most are placed in charge of Astropathic
	  facilities and relay stations dotted across Imperial
	  space. Those with the sharpest wits become itinerant
	  emissaries or officials of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica
	  itself or serve on the staff of Inquisitors or Lord Militants.
	  Some of the most self-aware and strong-willed of their
	  kind serve their vigils alongside Rogue Traders, casting
	  their thoughts out far beyond the realms of Man into the
	  great voids beyond the Emperor’s Domains.
	  It takes a special type of Astropath to serve on the fringes of
	  what is known, and such Astropaths must be both hard-hearted
	  and savvy individualists if they are to persevere. Though the
	  experiences vary wildly from one Astropath to the next, many are
	  driven slowly mad by what they describe as cold, alien thoughts
	  echoing in the black gulfs at the edges of the galaxy, while others
	  find themselves growing increasingly alone the further out they
	  travel, as the psychic voices of their fellows recede into the celestial
	  distance. Those few that can endure these rigours are granted the
	  title of Astropath Transcendent, and are both respected and a little
	  feared by their contemporaries
	  The duties of the Astropath Transcendent are a microcosm of those
	  performed by the more established and ordinary psychic choirs of the
	  Adeptus Astra Telepathica. Most Rogue Trader fleets are accompanied
	  by little more than a handful of Astropaths, with perhaps only one being
	  stationed on each vessel, and so their position is one of grave responsibility.
	  They provide the only means of viable communication between widely scattered
	  vessels, not to mention across interstellar distances, and as a consequence are
	  highly valued members of the Rogue Trader’s inner circle. Many Rogue
	  Traders would not even consider setting foot on the soil of a new world
	  without an Astropath Transcendent at their side, ready to summon
	  aid at a moment’s notice should disaster strike.`,
